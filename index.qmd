### Hello, my name is

# Stephen Salerno

I am a postdoctoral fellow in Biostatistics at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, working with Jeff Leek. I received my PhD and MS in Biostatistics from the University of Michigan under the supervision of Yi Li, and a BS in Biometry and Statistics from Cornell University.  

My research focuses on:

- Statistical methods for drawing inference on AI/ML-generated data  
- Deep learning for high-dimensional data and correlated survival endpoints  
- Survival analysis for oncology and chronic disease  
- Causal inference in settings of complex sampling

I also work on clinical quality measure development, public reporting, and health policy, especially in kidney disease and lung cancer, and I am committed to building user-friendly software and contributing to data-for-good initiatives.

<!-- RESEARCH AT A GLANCE --

# My Research At a Glance

I think about the full pipeline: **learning from complex data, using predictions as inputs, and still doing valid statistical inference.**

<!-- RESEARCH OVERVIEW --

::: {#research .column-screen style="padding: 3rem 1.5rem; max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;"}

## Research Overview

I currently focus on three main areas:

* **Inference with Predicted Data**
  Developing methods like PPI, PPI++, PSPA, and related frameworks to enable valid downstream inference when key variables are imputed or predicted by complex models (e.g., deep neural networks, random forests).

* **Deep Learning and High-Dimensional Modeling**
  Building and deploying deep learning models — often in R via <code>torch</code> and transformer architectures — for imaging and other high-dimensional biomedical data, with an emphasis on interpretability and integration with classical statistical models.

* **Survey Methods, Quality Measures, and Health Policy**
  Methods for stratified and cluster sampling, bias correction, and variance estimation, with applications to clinical quality measure development, public reporting, and health policy in oncology and nephrology.

I aim to bridge **modern machine learning** with **rigorous statistical inference**, and to release open-source software so others can use these tools in applied research.
