I received my PhD and MS in Biostatistics from the University of Michigan under the supervision of Yi Li, and a BS in Biometry and Statistics from Cornell University.\nMy research focuses on:\n\nStatistical methods for drawing inference on algorithmically derived variables (post-prediction inference)\n\nDeep learning for high-dimensional data\n\nSurvival analysis and causal questions in oncology and chronic disease\n\nI also work on clinical quality measures, public reporting, and health policy, especially in kidney disease and lung cancer, and I am committed to building user-friendly software and contributing to data-for-good initiatives."

    "text": "Research Overview\nI currently focus on three main areas:\n\nInference with Predicted Data Developing methods like PPI, PPI++, PSPA, and related frameworks to enable valid downstream inference when key variables are imputed or predicted by complex models (e.g., deep neural networks, random forests).\nDeep Learning and High-Dimensional Modeling Building and deploying deep learning models — often in R via torch and transformer architectures — for imaging and other high-dimensional biomedical data, with an emphasis on interpretability and integration with classical statistical models.\nSurvey Methods, Quality Measures, and Health Policy Methods for stratified and cluster sampling, bias correction, and variance estimation, with applications to clinical quality measure development, public reporting, and health policy in oncology and nephrology.\n\nI aim to bridge modern machine learning with rigorous statistical inference, and to release open-source software so others can use these tools in applied research."
