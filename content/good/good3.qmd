### Data for Good, by Design

Data science can change policy, shape narratives, and support communities—not just produce papers.  
My work in **data for good** focuses on three pillars:

- **STATCOM** – community-engaged consulting with non-profits  
- **MIDAS** – student leadership and cross-campus programming  
- **CAIA** – trustworthy AI for cancer care

## Statistics in the Community (STATCOM) 🤝  
### Pro bono consulting for community partners

As president of **Statistics in the Community (STATCOM)** at the University of Michigan, I helped coordinate teams of graduate students providing **free statistical consulting** to non-profit and community organizations.

Projects included:

- Community health perceptions after the **Flint Water Crisis**
- **Trans youth advocacy**, including program evaluation and measurement
- **Food access and food deserts**, quantifying gaps and evaluating interventions
- Program evaluation and dashboarding for youth-serving organizations

**STATCOM @ U-M** connects graduate students with community partners who need analytical support but lack in-house data science capacity.

#### Why this model works

- Community partners get **access to expertise** they couldn’t otherwise afford  
- Students learn to work with **real-world, messy data** and real constraints  
- Projects often seed **long-term collaborations** and follow-up work

### Highlight: Starr Commonwealth 🌱  
A collaboration with **Starr Commonwealth** focused on understanding program outcomes and improving decision-making:

- Building a Shiny-based dashboard to explore key indicators over time  
- Creating interpretable visual summaries for non-technical stakeholders  
- Supporting **continuous evaluation**, not just a one-off report

## MIDAS Student Leadership Team 🎓  
### Building a campus-wide data for good community

The **MIDAS Student Leadership Team** (Michigan Institute for Data Science) brings together students from across campus who care about:

- Data science education and training  
- Community-building and mentorship  
- Projects with clear **public-good or social-impact** goals  

My contributions have included:

- Designing student-facing programming (seminars, workshops, mixers)  
- Advocating for **inclusive, accessible pathways** into data science  
- Connecting students with **real-world projects** that mirror STATCOM’s impact model  

::: callout-note
#### Through MIDAS, STATCOM, and CAIA  
I’m working toward an ecosystem where students can move **seamlessly** between:
- learning core methods,  
- applying them in community settings, and  
- pushing on the frontier of AI for health.

## Cancer AI Alliance (CAIA) 🧬  
### Trustworthy AI for precision oncology

The **Cancer AI Alliance (CAIA)** focuses on building **clinically meaningful, trustworthy AI tools** for cancer research and care.

My work within CAIA emphasizes:

- Developing and validating AI/ML models for **precision oncology**
- Studying how AI-predicted quantities can be used responsibly in **downstream statistical inference**
- Designing workflows so models are transparent, reproducible, and aligned with real clinical needs  

::: grid

::: callout-important
#### Principles that guide this work

- **Rigor** – robust validation, including out-of-distribution performance  
- **Transparency** – clear documentation of models, data, and limitations  
- **Equity** – attention to bias, representation, and downstream impacts  
- **Longevity** – infrastructure that can be maintained beyond a single grant

## Data for Public Good Symposium 📣  
### Bringing methods and impact together

The **Data for Public Good Symposium** highlights projects that blend methodological innovation with real-world impact. My involvement has included:

- Presenting work on community-engaged data science and **prediction-powered inference**
- Showcasing collaborations with non-profits, public health partners, and clinical teams
- Helping connect students and researchers to **data-for-good opportunities**
