Beyond research, the areas of service to our field that I am most passionate about are data science education and data for good outreach. As a doctoral student, I served as the president of Statistics in the Community (STATCOM), a volunteer student organization that provides pro bono statistical consulting services to non-profit and community organizations. This work was a privilege, allowing me to engage in diverse projects, from understanding community health perceptions after the Flint Water Crisis to trans youth advocacy and access to fresh produce in food deserts. I found that this work benefits both community partners and students – community partners benefit from resources not readily available to them due to budget or knowledge constraints, and students benefit from working with real data and collaborators with meaningful, tangible questions that impact their local community. This work is something I hope to continue in an advisory role in the next stage of my career, establishing a STATCOM chapter if one does not already exist in my department.
