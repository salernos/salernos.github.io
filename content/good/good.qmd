Beyond research, I am deeply committed to data science education and data for good outreach. As a doctoral student, I served as president of **Statistics in the Community (STATCOM)**, a volunteer student organization that provides pro bono statistical consulting services to non-profit and community organizations. This work was a privilege, spanning projects from understanding community health perceptions after the Flint Water Crisis to supporting trans youth advocacy and improving access to fresh produce in food deserts.

This work benefits both **community partners**—who gain access to expertise and resources they might not otherwise have—and **students**, who gain experience working with real data and collaborators posing meaningful, tangible questions that affect their local communities. In the next stage of my career, I aim to continue this work through advisory roles, student leadership, and broader collaborations like the **MIDAS Student Leadership Team** and the **Cancer AI Alliance (CAIA)**.

## Statistics in the Community (STATCOM) {.section-underline}

As president of STATCOM at the University of Michigan, I helped coordinate teams of student volunteers working on projects with mission-driven organizations. These collaborations often involved:

- Designing and analyzing surveys to understand community needs
- Building predictive and descriptive models to guide program decisions
- Creating visualizations and tools that partners could use after our projects ended

### Select Projects

#### Starr Commonwealth

Working with **Starr Commonwealth**, we helped build tools to better understand program outcomes and inform resource allocation. This included a Shiny-based dashboard to:

- Summarize key indicators across programs and time
- Allow stakeholders to explore results interactively
- Support ongoing evaluation and decision-making by non-technical users

#### Other Community Partners

Additional STATCOM projects included:

- Assessing community perceptions and health concerns in the wake of the **Flint Water Crisis**
- Supporting **trans youth advocacy** groups in evaluating program reach and impact
- Quantifying **food access** gaps and designing analyses to support interventions in food deserts

## MIDAS Student Leadership Team

The **MIDAS Student Leadership Team** (Michigan Institute for Data Science) brings together students from across campus who are interested in data science, outreach, and community-building. As part of this team, I:

- Helped shape student-facing programming, including seminars, workshops, and networking events  
- Supported initiatives that connect students with real-world, socially impactful data projects  
- Advocated for inclusive, accessible training and mentorship pathways in data science

This work complements my STATCOM experience by extending data-for-good activities to a broader, cross-disciplinary community and by embedding data science education within a larger institutional ecosystem.

## Cancer AI Alliance (CAIA)

The **Cancer AI Alliance (CAIA)** is a collaborative effort focused on building trustworthy, impactful AI tools for cancer research and care. My involvement centers on:

- Developing and evaluating AI/ML models for precision oncology
- Studying how **AI-generated predictions** can be used responsibly in downstream statistical inference  
- Building infrastructure and workflows so that models are transparent, reproducible, and aligned with real clinical needs

Within CAIA, I view “data for good” as encompassing not only community-facing outreach, but also responsible deployment of AI in high-stakes settings—ensuring that methods are rigorously validated, interpretable, and equitable.

## Data for Public Good Symposium

The **Data for Public Good Symposium** highlights work at the intersection of data science, policy, and community impact. My contributions to this space include:

- Presenting work on community-engaged data science and prediction-powered inference  
- Serving as a bridge between methodological research and applied, community-driven projects  
- Helping surface examples where rigorous methods and local expertise come together to inform action
