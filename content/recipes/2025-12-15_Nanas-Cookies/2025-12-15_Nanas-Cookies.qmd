These cookies are traditionally served at weddings in many Italian families, but to us they were always just my Nana's cookies. We had them (and made them) whenever we went to her house, for every family gathering. They are a part of so many of my memories, and now they've become a family tradition of our own.

## Notes

These cookies don't have to be almond! If you have allergies, or if almond just isn't your favorite, vanilla, lemon, anisette, and many other extracts work beautifully. 

My grandma would often roll the dough out into logs and shape the cookies into bows. She would also sprinkle the cookies with rainbow nonpareils before the icing set (or let us kids!).
