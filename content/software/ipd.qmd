`ipd` is an R package implementing a unifying framework for **inference with predicted data**, 
including methods such as PPI, RePPI, and prediction-powered inference variants.

Key features:

- Unified interface that mirrors `glm()`
- Support for multiple IPD estimators via a single high-level API
- Tools for diagnostics, simulation, and workflow integration
