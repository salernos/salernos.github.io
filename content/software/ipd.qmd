### Overview

`ipd` is an open-source `R` software package for the downstream modeling of an outcome and its associated features where a potentially sizable portion of the outcome data has been imputed by an artificial intelligence or machine learning (AI/ML) prediction algorithm. The package implements several recent proposed methods for inference on predicted data (IPD) with a single, user-friendly wrapper function, `ipd`. The package also provides custom `print`, `summary`, `tidy`, `glance`, and `augment` methods to facilitate easy model inspection.
