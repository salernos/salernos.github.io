`scorcher` provides a composable, **Keras Functional-style** interface for building deep learning models in R 
using `torch`, with special attention to workflows needed for **inference with predicted data**.

Highlights:

- Functional API for multi-input, multi-output architectures
- Helpers for Hugging Face models and multimodal pipelines
- Designed to play nicely with `ipd` and related inference tooling
