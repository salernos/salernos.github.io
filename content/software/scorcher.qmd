### Overview

The `scorcher` package provides high-level functionality for building
and fitting deep learning models using the Torch library in R. By
simplifying model development through easy-to-use functions and ensuring
compatibility with existing R workflows and data structures, scorcher
facilitates the use of deep learning without the need for extensive
programming knowledge.

The package allows users to create, modify, and visualize models through
functions such as `initiate_scorch`, `scorch_layer`, `compile_scorch`,
and `fit_scorch`. The package flexibly handles tasks such as prediction,
classification, computer vision, diffusion, and more.
